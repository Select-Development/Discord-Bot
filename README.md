# README
An open-sourced beginners discord.py bot!

We have created this bot after many people asking for us to make something open sourced. Here is just a starter bot for you to get to grips with bot development. It has features from random images to moderation and utility. We hope this bot helps you on your adventure into coding!

## Setup

Coming soon!

## License
Whilst this project is licensed under a MIT license, you **must not** try to write it off as your own. It is strictly our work. You must not remove the credits command if you run  the full bot however if you take code snippets then that is not necessary. Commands that may not be removed from the bot are marked clearly.

As a side note, if you wish to add this bot to a bot list, you will need to make at list 1 cog of your own and modify the commands already provided.

## Support
Join our discord server for any support or guidance. You can ask in #community-support or open a ticket in #help. We also have a live chat feature on our website.
